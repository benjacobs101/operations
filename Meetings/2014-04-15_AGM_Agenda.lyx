\begin_layout Subsection
TL;DR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Existing system sucks, excluding potential members, including people who
 never attend nor pay on our Register of Members.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead we should tier the membership process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Register your interest, become an "associate member" (term under discussion)
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Access to the wiki, members area, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Easier management of newsletter subscriptions/etc 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pay as you go or subscription payment options 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Particularly suitable for people who only use the space a few times a year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Possibly suitable for minors? 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Set up regular payments, become a "supporter" 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Intended for people who use the space once or more per month

\begin_layout Subsection
What's wrong with the current process?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-paying/inactive members
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of our members (people who are on So Make It Ltd's official Register
 of Members) have never paid.
 Many have paid just once or twice.
 Many have not attended the space in months, if ever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Termination of membership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We currently have no formal process defined for terminating a member's membershi
p (e.g.
 in the event of repeated dangerous behaviour or abuse; or long term absense
 without "leave").
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) membership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many individuals don't want to commit to paying monthly to use the space
 from time to time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No supporter membership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some individuals would like to support the space monthly but do not want
 to divulge their address to our membership (UK law requires that all members
 have their address on our Register of Members and all members are entitled
 to view the Register of Members).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Guests don't have a way to "belong" before gaining full membership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the moment if you don't want to be a member there are many ways to stay
 informed but they're all pretty disparate; the only one we really push
 is the newsletter subscription, but that doesn't get a lot of love.
 It would be nice if interested parties could sign up and immediately get
 access to the members area/wiki/etc to make them feel more involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Proposed Solution
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Proposed-Solution"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I propose we change the Members Area (and thus the registration process)
 in the following ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Initial registration is for "associate" membership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Associate membership means that you are not on our register of members and
 has the following notable differences to membership:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
entering your address is optional
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no monthly subscription required (PAYG) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no voting rights 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no appearance on Register of Members 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Associate membership only requires one Trustee's approval
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Approval at this stage is for security reasons - e.g.
 preventing spam on the wiki, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Associate members must set up a subscription to request full membership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Via GoCardless or Standing Order preferably, this should ensure that the
 majority of full members are always up to date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(NOTE: We'll still need to accept cash payments for people with cashflow
 issues - the requirement should be something like "they must have had a
 subscription payment registered in the last month")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Full membership approval still requires a quorum of trustees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically speaking, in most cases this is approved within 48 hours; this
 is unchanged from the existing system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Associate members who have monthly subscription are called "supporters"
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "par:Supporter"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or similar; they get all the privileges of full membership except:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
don't appear on our Register of Members
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no voting rights 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no need to provide address (though it's highly encouraged) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
address is only visible to trustees and those directly involved with the
 spaces' paperwork 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
cannot become trustees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
"Associate membership" sounds terrible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I agree.
 Suggestions for better terminology welcome.

What's wrong with "associate member"?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It uses the word associate, which sounds terrible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It uses the word member, which on it's own may have legal connotations because
 we're a Company Limited by Guarantee (and we have a Register of Members)
 - we should avoid the word "member" if possible.

Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to specify who should be able to let themselves
 into the space and when.
 It does not specify the technical method use to implement the access restrictio
ns - think of it as a specification the Door Entry System should comply
 to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how Benjie thinks it should work, and is written formally in the
 interest of having an open discussion on this subject.
 If your idea of what should go on is significantly different I strongly
 encourage you to write your own proposal; feel free to use this one as
 a template (and to avoid confusion try and use the same definitions; though
 feel free to add your own or omit some).

\begin_layout Description
Open The space is Open when it is occupied (e.g.

 of disambiguation someone just popping in to pick something up versus stating
 for an hour or more
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Closed Not Open
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Space Access
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Guests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Guests should always be escorted around the space - not just for security
 but also for health and safety.
 For this reason to enter the space Guests will ring the door-bell and someone
 will let them in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Keyholder who opens the space must be willing to greet Guests since
 they are vital to the growth of So Make It and should always be made to
 feel welcome.
 However if there are more people in the space then others may let the Guest
 in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Access-less Member
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There should be no Access-less Members; however in the event that a Member
 loses their Key/Access Card or attends the space after registering but
 before receiving a Access Card they will be treated as a Guest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Access Cardholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the space is Open Access Cardholders should just be able to utilise
 their Access Card to open the door and gain entry to the space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The the space is Closed Access Cardholders will not be able to gain entry
 to the space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Keyholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keyholders can open the space and gain entry at any time.
 Please see Opening the Space below for further discussion around opening/closin
g the space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Becoming a Access Cardholder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All Members should be Access Cardholders almost immediately after registering.
 The process should be like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Register on the website to be a Member
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Get approved (by a quorum of Trustees)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Someone posts you a Welcome Pack including a Access Card (thereby verifying
 your address)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your Access Card might not be activated until the first time you visit the
 space (this may require intervention by a Keyholder to say that they've
 at least seen your face)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Becoming a Keyholder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All Members can become Keyholders; but first we need to check a few things:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They must prove their identity and address to a Trustee
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Identity can be verified via a driving license, passport, or anything else
 deemed suitable by the Trustee (e.g.
 if the Trustee knows them personally, works with them, or somehow otherwise
 knows their identity)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Address will be verified by possession of their Access Card.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
They must be known within the So Make It community
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
e.g.
 they must have visited the space at least 8 times and in at least 3 separate
 calendar weeks over a 3 month period
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
i.e.
 they cannot become a Keyholder until at least 3 weeks after they registered
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
They must be in good standing
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Subscription up to date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No violence/verbal abuse recorded
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No dangerous incidents recorded (e.g.
 using a power-tool under the influence of alcohol or illicit substances)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
They must be approved by a Trustee
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This may be a technical requirement (e.g it might be that only Trustees can
 upgrade the Access Card to a Key)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is also a fail-safe incase the rules above are insufficient to protect
 the Space and its Members
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Opening the Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only Keyholders can Open the space.
 Simply using their Key may open the Space, or they may be required to perform
 an additional action.
 This additional action can serve two purposes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Prevent the space being broadcast as open when really the Keyholder just
 popped in to get something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Getting an idea of how long the Space is likely to be open until (so Members
 and Guests don't waste time visiting the space if it's only likely to be
 open for an hour)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Keyholder who Opens the space must either Close the space when they
 leave; or they must pass on their Closing responsibility to another Keyholder.
 This does mean that a Keyholder may have to kick out Members when they
 leave, but hopefully we can address this in two ways: 1) by having a sufficient
 number of Keyholders, and 2) by having a way of recording how long the
 space is likely to be Open for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Closing the Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last Keyholder to leave the space must:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check that no-one remains in the space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check that the space is safe (no soldering irons/tools left switched on,
 no taps running, etc)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check that the space is secure (all windows and doors closed and locked)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Trigger the space closing script (e.g.
 that announces that the space is closed on IRC/Twitter/etc) - this may
 be manual or automatic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Turn off the lights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Lock the door (this may be manual or automatic)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Appendix: An Simple Example Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example is purely to show how the system could work with the proposal
 above, it is not to be treated as part of the proposal itself and it's
 likely that the technical solution we use to address the proposal will
 not be this example implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Keys/Access Cards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RFID lock on the door.
 Access Cards and Keys are both RFID cards.
 When an RFID card is scanned the system looks up the user and if they are
 a Keyholder then it lets them in; otherwise if they are a Access Cardholder
 it only lets them in if the space is Open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Opening
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Keyholder enters the space they flick the Space Opening Switch (like
 we had at rideride) which marks the space as Open and announces the opening
 to Twitter/IRC/etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Closing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the last Keyholder leaves the space they reset the Space Opening Switch,
 announcing that the space is closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be a Watchdog timer that automatically Closes the space if the
 door has not been opened in at least 2 hours unless someone inside the
 space presses a button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Problems with this implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No indication of how long the space will be open for
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This could be addressed by using a potentiometer or similar combined with
 an LCD display instead of a switch as the Space Opening Switch; this could
 also address the "having to kick people out" issue too.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Fails in a power cut
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A key override in the RFID lock is desirable, but the people who have access
 to this key should be severely limited (e.g.
 just the Trustees) since it doesn't involve any authentication.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Is software based and potentially hackable
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
May be best to run this off of a non-networked Pi that is locked securely;
 though doing so makes it harder to approve new Access Cardholder/Keyholders
 quickly
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The RFID lock may not be sufficiently strong for an external door.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This could be solved by using a heavy duty mechanical combination lock and
 giving the code to all Keyholders.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The combo lock needs to be able to be left in an unlocked state otherwise
 Access Cardholder would not be able to gain access to the space when it
 is Open.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Intention 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Trustees of So Make It have the authority to ban anyone from entering
 the space.
 This must only be done in circumstances where this authority is best for
 the So Make It and its members as a whole.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This policy will only be applied to members who demonstrate unwillingness
 to address behaviour which has caused offence, harm or distress to another
 member, members, visitors or affiliates of So Make It; or has threatened
 the safety of the space.
 This may be behaviour directly targeting or witnessed by any individual.
 Our rules clearly state that in the event of certain behaviour being reported
 that a ban is possible..
 Throughout the process, all efforts will be made to keep clear and constructive
 communication between the trustees, the offending party, and any other
 affected parties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In very serious cases, trustees may invoke temporary access bans until the
 issue is resolved.
 Should a trustee become the focus of a complaint, they will not be included
 in their normal capacity during the grievance process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This policy applies to members, guests and attendees of events that use
 So Make It or its online meeting places and social media platforms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Any person may be banned from the space if they violate existing policies
 or if they have the potential to harm other users of the space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Before the formal banning procedure is started, the trustees must make every
 attempt to resolve the issue informally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Process 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Should a trustee become the focus of a complaint, they will not be included
 in their normal capacity during the grievance process.
 ยง Where possible the offending party must be given at least two written
 warnings before being banned unless the trustees determine there is a continuin
g threat to the safety of members.
 At every stage, it must be made clear to the party where they are in this
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At every stage, a quorum of trustees must be in agreement that allowing
 the user to continue to use the space would not be in the best interest
 of the organisation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Should a quorum of trustees be unattainable, then a general meeting will
 be called at the first opportunity, with the only agenda item to be appointing
 enough members as temporary trustees to enable an investigation of the
 complaint.
 The remit of these members will be limited to the investigation, and they
 will be required to step down upon completion of the investigation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At every stage, the trustees must make their reasoning available to the
 offending party.
 They must also make as much detail as is appropriate available to all members
 but may hold back information if it is decided it is in the best interests
 of the space and its membership.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
By default, a ban will be for a year.
 At their discretion, the trustees can issue a reduced or extended ban period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bans of more than one year may only be issued in extreme circumstances.
 The trustees must review these bans yearly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the offending party is a member, the ban will trigger the process to
 remove the member.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When a person is banned, their right to access So Make It and its social
 media and communication platforms is revoked.
 Any entry to the space without the prior, express permission of trustees
 will be considered trespass.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The trustees must seek feedback from the community to ensure this process
 remains fair and balanced.

Details
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We go in a 4 week Monday-Sunday cycle - first week any donations go on the
 Blue shelf, second week they go on the Green shelf, third Orange, fourth
 Pink, fifth Blue, Green, Orange, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anything on the next colour's shelf (e.g.
 things on the Orange shelf when the week is Green) is soon to be junk so
 can be torn down, hacked or taken away without guilt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anything on the other two shelves (e.g.
 things on the Orange/Pink shelves when the week is Green) is available
 for a donation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each week someone should change the poster to reflect the current week's
 colour and remove all items on that coloured shelf (e.g.
 the Green shelf when the week is Green) ready to be disposed of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Further rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many donations should be turned away - particularly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Large/bulky items 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Items that require special disposal (batteries, items containing asbestos,
 ...) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Items that don't look useful 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Illegal, illicit or items of unknown origin 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Chemicals unless they've been previous approved by a Trustee - chemicals
 should never be placed on the donations shelves - they must be handled
 separately for H&S/COSHH reasons

 The following options are suggested:

\begin_layout Enumerate
Our AGM is fine - we can decide things on trello/google groups 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once every 6 months is more sensible - any volunteers to chair and organise
 it? (doesn't have to be a trustee!)

Once every 3 months is doable and I Chris volunteer to help chair and organise
 it.

, or, more specifically, "Supporters" since they need to pay a monthly subscript
ion.
 Friends may have to jump a few more hoops to store their stuff here (e.g.
 have turned up a few time and thus become known to the community) but are
 treated basically equivalently to Members.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The space can provide storage for it's users, but storage is at a premium.
 Users' items should be stored only inside authorised storage boxes.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
How much can I store?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount a user can store is based on their subscription level (and available
 space).
 The first ยฃ15/mo covers basic usage of the space (no storage), above this
 the allowance is allocated as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
each:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
+ยฃ5/mo adds a small box to your allowance, or 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
+ยฃ10/mo adds a medium box to your allowance, or 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
+ยฃ15/mo adds a large box to your allowance
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
For
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

example:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ยฃ15/mo - no storage allowance 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ยฃ20/mo - a small box 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ยฃ25/mo - a medium box 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ยฃ30/mo - a large box 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ยฃ35/mo - a large box and a small box 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ยฃ45/mo - two large boxes 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Please keep in mind you're not being charged for the boxes/storage - instead
 your subscription level (which goes towards covering all the costs inherent
 in the space) allows you to use an amount of storage (if it's available).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What are the authorised storage boxes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These will change from time to time and are always to be provided by So
 Make It (users should not provide their own storage boxes).
 Currently proposed are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Small: cardboard box from Ikea 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Medium: medium translucent plastic box from The Range 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Large: large translucent plastic box from The Range 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What can't I store?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No storage of dangerous chemicals (these should be kept in dedicated chemical
 storage), explosives, illegal or illicit materials, offensive materials
 or other materials that the trustees deem to be inappropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Termination of storage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your subscription is not up to date, or no longer covers your storage,
 then someone will attempt to notify you that you have 4 weeks to fix your
 subscription or remove the stored items from the space.
 If this period elapses without resolution then the items stored become
 the property of So Make It Ltd.
 It is your responsibility to ensure that the trustees of So Make It always
 have a valid method of reaching you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Other rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Boxes are assigned by Space Keepers (or Trustees until we have a Space Keeper
 role).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Space is allocated on a first-come first-served basis as we only have limited
 space available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Unused or near-empty boxes may be downgraded or removed without warning
 in order to free up space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Boxes remain the property of So Make It Ltd and should be treated with respect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Full name and membership/friend identification number must be written on
 the box using the labels provided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
No storage for guests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Users are responsible for their own storage.

NFC locks only proposal

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Enumerate
Confirm that we are happy to stop using a physical deadlock and only use
 NFC access as described above.
 This is a weaker latch than the deadlock, but I believe strong enough for
 our current use 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Alternatively we could spend ~ยฃ50-ยฃ100 on a stronger electric strike/latch
 to improve the security.

 I would like to put ยฃ100 of SMI funds towards getting the Dalek build project

My view is this will benefit the space in the long run plus hopefully may
 raise far more than that ยฃ100 for the space if we use the Dalek at events.
