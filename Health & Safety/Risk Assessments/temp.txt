We have two new tools at the space, a replacement drill press for the one Andy was lending us and a new bench grinder as the old one was unsafe.

We’ll upload documentation to the wiki and github (volunteers to do this welcome) which I suggest is read by anybody wanting to use the tools.  Please be well aware these tools are extremely dangerous when used incorrectly and if you are in any doubt on how to use them properly, you should ask for assistance.

If we see the tools being used dangerously we can and will issue warnings and even bans!

The list of important safety things to consider when using the tools is extensive but these are the most important:

Never grind non ferrous materials - aluminium for example.
Clamp workpieces down securely where appropiete - flying bits of wood can injure or even kill!
Wear appropriate safety gear!  We have loads around the space.
Guards are there for a reason - use them!
Make sure your workspace is free of clutter
Use common sense - most of you have it
Please look after yourselves and of course look after the tools.  Taken care of properly they will last for years but of course will ultimately break down.  If a tool isn't working or you break a drill bit etc tell us!   We won't mind, things do break - but we need to know.

Many thanks.
